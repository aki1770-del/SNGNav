# Changelog

## 0.4.1

- Republish from the embedded-target Dart 3.10.1 SDK (Flutter 3.38.3) to correct a stale
  `^3.11.0` SDK floor in the previously-published artifact. No source or behavior change; the
  source already declared `sdk: ^3.10.0`. Restores `pub get` for embedded/automotive Dart
  consumers on Dart 3.10.x.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-10 — dart format alignment

- Apply `dart format` across `lib/`, `test/`, and `tool/` (10 files
  reformatted) to clear pana static-analysis formatter findings.
- pubspec `description` already within ≤180-character target; no trim
  needed.
- No SDK source changes; formatter pass only.

## 0.3.0

- Harmonize package version to 0.3.0 for Sprint 80 Direction F.
- Align internal ecosystem dependency constraints to ^0.3.0 where applicable.
- No breaking API changes in this package for this release.
